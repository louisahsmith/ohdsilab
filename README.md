<hr/>

The goals of the ohdsilab R package are two fold: 

1. Streamline working with the OHDSI-Lab database at the Roux Institute (and other OMOP CDM databases)

2. Provide an easier onramp for students and researchers new to working with the OMOP CDM or SQL 
databases. 

The package contains functions and template code snippets to facilitate easier use
of the Ohdsilab. These functions and snippits build on existing OHDSI R packages like
{DatabaseConnector} as well as standard R packages like {dplyr} and {tidyr}. The package also contains
a number of vingettes intended for R users who are new to OHDSI-Lab, the OMOP CDM, or working with 
data in SQL databases from R. 

If you're a new ohdsilab user, you can get set up by [following the user guide](https://northeastern.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/OHDSINortheastern/Shared%20Documents/OHDSI%20Lab%20-%20User%20Group?csf=1&web=1&e=lvfisr). 

After you've created your workspace and have successfully logged in, finish setting
up your R environment by [completing the setup tutorial](https://roux-ohdsi.github.io/ohdsilab/articles/01-intro-to-ohdsilab.html)
